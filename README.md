Website containing my favorite video songs

This website contains some of my best songs in grid format.

i) There is a button "Toggle Lyrics Panel" at top-left corner which is used to open a sidepanel which is used to display lyrics. Once the title of song is clicked then the lyrics of song is displayed at sidepanel if it is opened.
ii) There is no collision of playing multiple songs simultaneously because if one song is playing then if other song is clicked to play then previous will be paused.
iii) All songs have button "Play at top" below them. When clicked on them then that video song is played at top of page of every other songs with dimension 1024x576.
iv) For the song playing at top there are two navigation button to move to next song and previous song.
v) There is another button at top-left corner to toggle repeat 'off' or 'all'. When the repeat is toggled to all the song once ended then next songs starts playing. This applied for both songs playing in agrid and songs playing at top.
vi) There is another button at top-left corner to set quality to 'low', 'medium' or 'high'. Quality will be set for only those songs whose respective quality versions are available. This applied for song in grid not for songs playing at top.
